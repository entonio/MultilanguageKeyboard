MultilanguageKeyboard
=====================

The purpose of this project is to add more accented letters to those than can be written using the existing keyboard layouts, by allowing combinations that are not used in the standard layouts.

The starting point are the existing layouts, to which new combinations are added.


Installation
------------

macOS:

- Put MultilanguageKeyboard.bundle in `~/Library/Keyboard Layouts/`
- Add the new layout in **Preferences -> Keyboard -> Keyboard Types**
- Select the added layout using the menu bar icon
